<a href="#" onclick="tileClick('https://www.3dslash.net/slash.php', '3D Slash', event);">3D Slash</a>
is a free web-based app for creating 3D models suitable for 3D printing.
This tool is easier to user and more playful than
<a href="#" onclick="helpClick('#TinkerCad3DDesignDialog', event);">Tinkercad</a>
but is not as expressive.
An alternative to creating designs by direct manipulation of the interface is
<a href="#" onclick="helpClick('#BeetleBloxDialog', event);">BeetleBlocks</a>
which supports creating programs that construct 3D models.

The eCraft2Learn project provides no support or integration for this tool.
