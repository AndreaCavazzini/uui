<h2>3D Slash</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://www.3dslash.net" target="_blank">3D Slash</a>
is a free web-based app for creating 3D models suitable for 3D printing.
This tool is easier to user and more playful than
<a href="tinkercad-3d-design-help.html" target="_blank">Tinkercad</a>
but is not as expressive.
An alternative to creating designs by direct manipulation of the interface is
<a href="beetleblocks-help.html" target="_blank">BeetleBlocks</a>
which supports creating programs that construct 3D models.
</p>
<p>
The eCraft2Learn project provides no support or integration for this tool.
