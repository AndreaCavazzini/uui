<p>
<a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a> is a commericial programming language that is free and included in the standard <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> release.
It has facilties for communicating with the Raspberry Pi pins and with a <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/device/Arduino.html">connected Arduino</a>.
It has support for machine learning including a <a href="http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2017/05/machine-learning-for-middle-schoolers/">chapter in a high school text book</a> with many project ideas.
It also provides easy access to a large variety of open data sources.
<a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/format/STL.html">3D models suitable for printing can also be created in Mathematica</a>, though in many cases doing so requires a high-level of mathematical sophistication.
</p>
<p>
This could be a good programming tool for eCraft2Learn projects for those familiar with the Mathematica programming language.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://project.ecraft2learn.eu/">eCraft2Learn project</a> provides no support or integration for this tool.
