<h2>Trello</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> is an easy to use web app designed for project collaborative organization. 
The work is divided into boards, and each board consists of several lists (or cards) that represent different stages of the work or different tasks, including deadlines. 
Trello communicates also with Google Drive, importing and attaching files from there. 
The best way to explore Trello is to try on its own.
