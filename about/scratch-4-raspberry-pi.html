<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/scratch/">Scratch for the Raspberry Pi</a> is a free app and it is included in the standard <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> release.
It has ability to communicate with the Raspberry Pi pins that (confusingly) relies upon broadcasting primitive blocks.
It is not web-based and programs created cannot be shared at the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch web site</a>.
It is <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/scratch/gpio/README.md">documented here</a>.
