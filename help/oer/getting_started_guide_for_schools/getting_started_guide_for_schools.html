<h3>Your very first print</h3>
<p>To try out your printer and print your very first object,&nbsp;the SD Card provided with your printer has two lovely&nbsp;test print files on. My favourite is the Ultimaker Robot,&nbsp;this is a relatively quick print (approx 30 mins) and&nbsp;makes a nice keyring attachment keepsake.</p>
<p>You might want to set the print going at the beginning&nbsp;of a lesson with your students so they can see the&nbsp;finished robot before the end of the lesson and take it&nbsp;in turns to visit the printer to watch it in action.</p>

<h2>Understanding the&nbsp; 3 D Printing process</h2>
<h3>Before introducing 3D printing to your students, if the technology and processes are completely new to you,&nbsp; you may benefit from learning more about the process and workflow involved in creating 3D prints.</h3>
<p>Our CREATE ambassador Steve Cox has published a video tutorial that guides you through this process. It explains step by step how to go from design to physical object and helping to take out the mystery surrounding 3D Printing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.createeducation.com/resource/3d-printing-workflow/">http://www.createeducation.com/resource/3d-printing-workflow/</a>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Introducing 3D Printing to your students</h3>
<p>It is beneficial to introduce 3D printing to your students before embarking on any 3D printing projects, this will allow them to become familiar with the process, engage and inspire them.</p>
<p>The Resources section of the CREATE Education website includes a couple of introduction to 3D printing ideas and resources:</p>
<p>Introduction to 3D Printing Lesson: <strong><a href="http://www.createeducation.com/resource/introduction-to-3d-printing">http://www.createeducation.com/resource/introduction-to-3d-printing</a>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Moving on - developing your first project</h2>
<h3>If you are unsure where to start for your first 3D printing project the best place to look is in the resources area of the CREATE Education website: http://www.createeducation.com/ resource</h3>
<p>Here there are a number of project ideas and resources that have been shared with the community, for Nursery, Primary and Secondary schools. New project ideas and resources are being added all the time.</p>
<p>Your first 3D print project will depend on a number of factors, the main two considerations are the age of the students and their previous experience and ability with 3D CAD software.</p>
<p>If students are very young or have no prior 3D CAD experience, you may want to start with a project that turns a 2D image into a 3D object. The following tutorial runs through this process: http://www.createeducation.com/resource/imagine-itin-2d-make-it-in-3d-making-3d-models-from-jpegs-bysteve-cox/</p>
<p>Projects that can utilise this technique include designing personalised bookmarks, keyrings, door name plates or drink coasters. The 2D image can be created by using a simple 2D drawing program or by using a black marker pen to draw a design on white paper then photographing the finished design.</p>
<p>If you want students to utilise 3D CAD software the first thing you need to consider is which software to use. If students are not familiar with the software, you need to plan sufficient time in the project for students to learn the key features of the software and develop their 3D drawing skills prior to them creating their own designs. This may involve demonstrating key processes, allowing students to work through software tutorials or just providing them with sufficient tinkering time to allow them to discover the features for themselves and share what they know with their peers.</p>
<p>In initial projects you may want to provide students with a template 3D file that they remix or customise or they may select, download and adapt a 3D file from one of the file repositories such as YouMagine:&nbsp;<strong>www.youmagine.com </strong></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<h2>Which 3D CAD&nbsp;Software?</h2>
<h3>Selecting which 3D CAD software you use is a key decision which depends greatly on the age, ability and experience of the students. A number of different software platforms have been used successfully in the CREATE community. The following FREE software programs are some of the favourites amongst our community.</h3>
<p><strong>For Beginners (Ages 4+)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TinkerCAD</li>
<li>3D Slash</li>
</ul>
<p>Intermediate (Ages 9+)</p>
<ul>
<li>Autodesk 123Design</li>
<li>Sketchup</li>
</ul>
<p>Advanced (Ages 13+)</p>
<ul>
<li>Autodesk Fusion 360</li>
<li>Blender</li>
</ul>

<h2>Integrating 3D Printing in&nbsp;the Curriculum</h2>
<div>In order to maximise your investment in a 3D Printer, there are many opportunities for integrating 3D printing<br />throughout the curriculum, here are some ideas to get you started:</div>
<h3>1. Print your own classroom resources</h3>
<p>One of the benefits of having a 3D Printer in school is that it provides a low cost solution for equipping classrooms with physical teaching resources and manipulatives.</p>
<p>Why buy expensive resources when you can print your own for a fraction of the cost? In fact you may find that in utilising your 3D Printer in this way you have a better resourced school and the printer pays for itself.</p>
<p>Visit the &ldquo;Classroom Resources&rdquo; section of the CREATE website for more information, ideas and links to classroom prints.</p>
<p><strong>http://www.createeducation.com/resource/ classroom-prints/</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Introduce a weekly cross-curricular activity</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Object of the Week&rdquo; is a fully resourced open-ended classroom project developed by the Create Education Project to provide regular opportunities throughout the year for students to explore the world of 3D printing.</p>
<p>A series of stand-alone classroom activities have been developed to support the project. The activities allow students to:</p>
<ul>
<li>use their imagination</li>
<li>develop speaking and listening skills</li>
<li>develop descriptive and creative writing skills</li>
<li>be creative</li>
<li>develop research, evaluation and presentation skills</li>
<li>explore future careers</li>
<li>learn how real life problems are solved</li>
<li>develop their own solutions</li>
</ul>
<p>Visit the &ldquo;Object of the Week&rdquo; section of the CREATE website for more information, and to download the teaching resources.</p>
<p><strong>http://www.createeducation.com/object-of-the-week/ </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Utilise 3D printing by running a STEM/ STEAM club or class projects Utilise 3D printing by running a STEM/STEAM club or class projects</h3>
<p><img id="img1" src="/uui/help/oer/getting_started_guide_for_schools/getting_started_guide_for_schools_images/image022.jpg" alt="" width="207" height="256" /></p>
<p>3D printing lends itself particularly well to STEM and STEAM projects. There are many STEM free club projects available with supporting resources developed by a number of external organisations, many of the projects and activities lend themselves well to 3D printing as part of the outcome. To browse projects and activities visit <strong>http://www.stemclubs. net/activity-categories/ </strong></p>
<p>Many of the schools in our community are already running projects suitable for STEM clubs. All the resources and blog posts on the CREATE Education website have been tagged to the appropriate subject areas including STEM/STEAM. You can filter the resources and posts by STEM/STEAM to find resources and ideas. Remember to revisit the website regularly as new resources, ideas and inspiration are being added all the time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Run an enterprise project</h3>
<p>3D printing lends itself perfectly to running enterprise projects. Students can work in teams with different management roles to develop ideas and designs for objects to print and sell to the school community.</p>
<p>Ideas for low cost, quick to print items include keyrings, bookmarks, trolley tokens, and christmas tree decorations. However by giving students a brief that includes maximum size or cost constraints, students will come up unique ideas of their own.</p>
<p>As Cura gives you an indication of how much filament is required for each print, students can calculate the cost to produce each print and determine selling price and calculate their profit at the end of each project.</p>
<p>Students can develop advertising campaigns and work in competition with each other to make the most profit.</p>
<p>Read about how Kennoway Primary School ran an enterprise activity using their Ultimaker on our blog. <strong>http://www.createeducation.com/blog/kennowayprimary-school </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. Consider ways in which 3D printing can be used across different subject areas</h3>
<p>All the resources and blog posts on the CREATE Education website have been tagged to the appropriate subject areas. You can filter the resources and posts by subject to find ideas for how you can use it in different subject areas. You can also filter the resources to find specific resource types including planning resources, lessons, projects, tutorials and more. Remember to revisit the website regularly as new resources, ideas and inspiration are being added all the time.</p>
