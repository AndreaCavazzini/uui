<p><img id="img1" src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2plus_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image015.gif?raw=true" alt="" width="44" height="38" /></p>
<p>Before connecting, make sure the power switch is in the &ldquo;off&rdquo; position.<br />Only use the power supply that came with your Ultimaker 2+.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4&nbsp;OPERATION</h2>
<h3>After the installation, it&rsquo;s time to turn on your Ultimaker 2+ and start printing.&nbsp;This chapter provides information about the display, first use, how to level the&nbsp;bed, how to load and change the filament, the Cura software and how to change&nbsp;nozzles.&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>DISPLAY AND CONTROLLER</h3>
<p>The display at the front side of the Ultimaker 2+ shows all the necessary information for setting up and using your&nbsp;Ultimaker 2+. You can navigate through menus by rotating and/or pushing the button at the right side of the display.&nbsp;Rotate to select or control an action; push to confirm an action. When pushing the button you will hear a &ldquo;beeping&rdquo;&nbsp;sound to confirm the action. A blinking button means the Ultimaker 2+ is waiting for user input.</p>
<p>When turning on your Ultimaker 2+ after the first use, you will always see the Ultimaker logo first after which the main&nbsp;menu appears. The main menu offers three options: &ldquo;Print&rdquo;, &ldquo;Material&rdquo; and &ldquo;Maintenance&rdquo;.</p>
<p><br /><strong>PRINT</strong><br />The &ldquo;Print&rdquo; menu allows you to select one of the print files from the SD card. Press the button to start.</p>
<p><strong>MATERIAL</strong><br />In the &ldquo;Material&rdquo; menu, you can either change the filament on your Ultimaker 2+ or change the settings of material&nbsp;profiles. When selecting &ldquo;Change&rdquo;, the Ultimaker 2+ will start the procedure as described in &ldquo;LOADING AND&nbsp;CHANGING&nbsp;FILAMENT&rdquo; on page 22. In the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; menu, you can select material profiles and change their settings in the&nbsp;&ldquo;Customize&rdquo; menu.</p>
<p><br /><strong>MAINTENANCE</strong><br />The &ldquo;Maintenance&rdquo; menu offers various options. By selecting &ldquo;Build plate&rdquo; you will be guided through the bed leveling&nbsp;steps. In the &ldquo;Advanced&rdquo; menu, several options can be selected in order to perform certain actions manually or change&nbsp;machine settings. These are the options:<br />&bull; LED settings: Change the settings of the LED lights in your Ultimaker 2+.<br />&bull; Heatup nozzle: Set custom temperature to manually heat up the nozzle.<br />&bull; Heatup buildplate: Set a custom temperature to manually heat up the heated bed.<br />&bull; Home head: Homes the head in the left back corner of the Ultimaker 2+.<br />&bull; Lower buildplate: Moves the build plate to the bottom of the Ultimaker 2+.<br />&bull; Raise buildplate: Moves the build plate to the top of the Ultimaker 2+.<br />&bull; Insert material: Heats up the nozzle after which you can insert filament.<br />&bull; Move material: Heats up the nozzle after which you can use the scroll wheel to forward the material.<br />&bull; Set fan speed: Set the speed of the two fans at the sides of the print head.<br />&bull; Retraction settings: Customize the settings for retraction.<br />&bull; Version: Shows the current firmware version on the Ultimaker 2+.<br />&bull; Runtime stats: Shows for how much time the Ultimaker 2+ has been on and printing.<br />&bull; Factory reset: A complete reset of your Ultimaker 2+ through which you can completely recalibrate it.</p>
<p><strong>FINE-TUNING</strong><br />You can fine-tune the settings during the printing process. This allows you to get full control over the printing process&nbsp;and helps you achieving the best print results. You can do this by accessing the &ldquo;Tune&rdquo; menu during printing. The&nbsp;&ldquo;Tune&rdquo; menu basically shows you the same settings as in the &ldquo;Advanced&rdquo; menu, which means that you can change&nbsp;settings such as the temperature and speed of printing. Furthermore, it is possible to select &ldquo;Pause&rdquo;, after which you&nbsp;can change the filament in the middle of a print and resume again.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2plus_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image062.png?raw=true" alt="" width="450" height="193" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>FIRST USE</h3>
<p>When you turn on the Ultimaker 2+ for the first time, the display shows &ldquo;Welcome&rdquo;. The Ultimaker 2+ will guide you&nbsp;through some steps for calibrating the build plate. Follow the instructions shown in the display. The Ultimaker 2+ will&nbsp;do the &ldquo;homing&rdquo; first. This means that it will move the print head to the left back corner and the build plate towards the&nbsp;bottom, in order to set the origin point. After this, you can start the bed leveling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img id="img1" src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2plus_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image016.png?raw=true" alt="" width="48" height="40" />If you do not see the configuration wizard, navigate to &ldquo;Maintenance&rdquo; &gt; &ldquo;Advanced&rdquo; and confirm<br />&ldquo;Factory reset&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2plus_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image065.jpg?raw=true" alt="" width="340" height="508" /></p>
<h3>BED LEVELING</h3>
<p>For printing it is very important that the first layer is nicely squished into the glass plate and sticks well. If the distance&nbsp;between the nozzle and build plate is too big, your print will not stick properly to the glass plate. On the other hand, if&nbsp;the nozzle is too close to the build plate, it can prevent the filament from extruding from the nozzle. To get the correct&nbsp;distance between the build plate and the nozzle, you need to level the build plate. You must do that before using the&nbsp;Ulitmaker 2+ for the first time and then periodically.</p>
<p>Always re-level the build plate when you notice that the plastic is not equally placed on the glass plate. After<br />transportation of your Ultimaker 2+, it is also advised to re-level the build plate to ensure your 3D prints stick well to&nbsp;the build plate.</p>
<p>To level the build plate:<br />1. Go to &ldquo;Maintenance&rdquo; &gt; &ldquo;Build plate&rdquo; to start the bed leveling process. (When using the Ultimaker 2+ for the first&nbsp;time, you can skip this step).<br />2. Wait for the Ultimaker 2+ to do its homing procedure and continue when the print head is in the center at the back&nbsp;of the build plate.<br />3. Rotate the button at the front until there is approximately 1 mm distance between the nozzle and the build plate.&nbsp;Make sure that the nozzle is close to the build plate without touching it.<br />4. Adjust the front left and front right build plate screw to roughly level the build plate at the front side. Again there&nbsp;should be a distance of approximately 1 mm between the nozzle and build plate.<br />5. Place the calibration card in between the nozzle and build plate.<br />6. Adjust the build plate screws on the front left side, front right side and the middle of the back until you feel slight&nbsp;friction when moving the card.<br />7. Press &ldquo;Continue&rdquo;. The print head moves to the second point.<br />8. Repeat step 4 &ldquo;place the calibration card&rdquo; and step 5 &ldquo;adjust the build plate&rdquo;.<br />9. Press &ldquo;Continue&rdquo; again. The print head moves to the third point.<br />10. Repeat step 4 &ldquo;place the calibration card&rdquo; and step 5 &ldquo;adjust the build plate&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2plus_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image067.png?raw=true" alt="" width="371" height="246" />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2+_user_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image068.png?raw=true" alt="" width="376" height="251" /></p>

This will lead to inaccuracies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>LOADING AND CHANGING FILAMENT</h3>
<p><strong>LOADING</strong><br />To load the filament:<br />1. Place the spool with the filament on the spool holder. Make sure to put it with the filament in counter-clockwise&nbsp;direction, so that the filament can enter the feeder from the bottom. Straighten the filament a bit so it can easily&nbsp;enter the feeder.<br />2. Wait a minute while the print head heats up. Heating up ensures that the filament melts when it goes through the&nbsp;nozzle.<br />3. Insert the end of the filament into the bottom of the feeder and push it until the filament is grabbed by the feeder.<br />4. Wait until the filament reaches the first black bowden tube clip and then press the button to continue. The<br />Ultimaker 2+ will automatically load the filament through the bowden tube, into the print head.<br />5. Wait until the filament comes out of the nozzle.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2plus_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image072.jpg?raw=true" alt="" width="391" height="261" />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2+_user_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image073.jpg?raw=true" alt="" width="394" height="262" /></p>
<p><img id="img1" src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2plus_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image015.gif?raw=true" alt="" width="67" height="57" /></p>
<p>Ensure that you do not touch the nozzle end during this procedure as it will become hot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img id="img1" src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2plus_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image016.png?raw=true" alt="" width="78" height="67" /></p>
<p>Ensure that the switch button on the right side of the feeder is in the middle. Then the tension on the feeder&nbsp;is set correctly.<br />Don&rsquo;t be surprised if the filament that initially comes out of the nozzle is not the color you expect. There is&nbsp;probably some residue from the test print left in the nozzle. Wait until you see the color of the filament that&nbsp;you loaded coming out of the nozzle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CHANGING</strong><br />If you want to switch between different (colors of) materials, you first need to unload the filament that is already in the&nbsp;Ultimaker 2+, after which you can insert the new filament.</p>
<p>To remove the old filament:<br />1. Go to &ldquo;Material&rdquo; &gt; &ldquo;Change&rdquo; in the main menu.<br />2. Wait a moment while the print head is heating up. Heating up the print head ensures that the filament melts when it&nbsp;goes through the nozzle.<br />3. When the nozzle is hot, the Ultimaker 2+ will automatically start turning the feeder wheel, through which the<br />filament will be rewind completely. If the filament doesn&rsquo;t come out of the feeder completely, you can pull it out<br />by hand.<br />4. Load the new filament as described above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>STARTING A PRINT</h3>
<p><strong>STARTING A PRINT</strong><br />When the build plate has been leveled and the filament has been loaded, you can start your (first) print. We&rsquo;ve placed&nbsp;some print files on the SD card to start with. Simply select one of the files and press the button to start.</p>
<p>After a print file has been chosen, the Ultimaker 2+ will prepare itself by homing the print head and build plate and&nbsp;heating up the build plate and nozzle. Please note that this can take up to 5 minutes.</p>
<p>While printing, the display will show the progress of the print and the remaining time for completion. When the print has&nbsp;finished, wait for the build plate to cool down and grab the print from the build plate.</p>
<p><img id="img1" src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2plus_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image015.gif?raw=true" alt="" width="44" height="38" /></p>
<p>Do not touch the print head/nozzle while it is heating, printing or cooling down. Temperatures can reach up to&nbsp;260&deg;C.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img id="img1" src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2plus_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image016.png?raw=true" alt="" width="53" height="45" /></p>
<p>For good platform adhesion it is recommended to apply a thin layer of glue to the glass plate. For this, you&nbsp;can use the glue stick delivered with the Ultimaker 2+. Refer to &ldquo;USING GLUE&rdquo; on page 25 for detailed&nbsp;instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>CURA SOFTWARE</h3>
<p>For the Ultimaker 2+, we recommend our free Cura software to prepare your 3D print files. Cura quickly and accurately&nbsp;converts 3D models into 3D print files within seconds, showing you a preview of the print so you can be sure everything&nbsp;is as you would like it to be.</p>
<p><strong>INSTALLATION</strong><br />The Cura software can be found at www.ultimaker.com/software. After downloading, open the installer and run the&nbsp;installation wizard to complete the installation. When opening Cura for the first time, you will be asked to select your 3D&nbsp;printer, the Ultimaker 2+. No other configuration is required and you can directly start using Cura.</p>
<p><strong>USING CURA</strong><br />To convert a 3D model to a print file in Cura:<br />1. Load a 3D model (STL, OBJ, DAE or AMF file) into Cura via the &ldquo;Load&rdquo; button.<br />2. Choose your desired settings and wait for Cura to slice the model.<br />3. After Cura has converted the file, save the print file (GCode) via the &ldquo;Save&rdquo; button. If the SD card has been inserted,&nbsp;it will directly save the file to the SD card.<br />4. Remove the SD card from your computer - make sure to remove it safely - and insert it into your Ultimaker 2+ to&nbsp;start printing.</p>

<p>When using Cura for the first time, you will see the &ldquo;Quickprint&rdquo; profiles. This is perfect for beginners, but&nbsp;when you&rsquo;re a more experienced user and want to have more control over the print settings you can also&nbsp;switch to the &ldquo;Advanced&rdquo; mode. For more information on using Cura, see the Cura support pages:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ultimaker.com/support/software">www.ultimaker.com/support/software</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>UPDATING FIRMWARE</strong><br />Periodically, a new Cura version is released, including a new firmware version. Make sure to install the latest version&nbsp;of Cura and firmware once available in order to stay up to date. The latest version of Cura can always be found at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ultimaker.com/software">www.ultimaker.com/software</a>.</p>
<p>To install the latest firmware on your Ultimaker 2+:</p>
<p>1. Connect the Ultimaker 2+ to your computer with the USB cable.<br />2. Connect the power supply and turn on the Ultimaker 2+.<br />3. Start Cura and go to &ldquo;Machine&rdquo; &gt; &ldquo;Install default firmware&rdquo; (make sure the Ultimaker 2+ is selected in the &ldquo;Machine&rdquo;&nbsp;menu). Cura will now automatically upload the latest firmware to your Ultimaker 2+.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>USING GLUE</h3>
<p><strong>USING GLUE</strong><br />Although the heat of the heated bed already ensures the adhesion of your print to the glass plate, this is not always&nbsp;enough. For even better adhesion, in some cases it is desired to use glue on the glass plate as well.</p>
<p><br /><strong>WHEN TO USE GLUE?</strong><br />The use of glue depends on the material you are using and the size and shape of the model.<br />For ABS and CPE, we recommend always using glue, because these materials have more &ldquo;warping&rdquo;. This means that&nbsp;the plastic will curl up. Warping basically happens because of the properties of the plastic. Plastics have the tendency to&nbsp;shrink when cooling down fast (some plastics more than others), which could eventually lead to your print curling up at&nbsp;the corners. Since ABS and CPE have a relatively big shrinkage, you will need glue to prevent it from warping.</p>
<p>PLA on the other hand, has a much lower shrinkage and thus less warping. Because of this, it&rsquo;s often possible to print&nbsp;PLA directly on the glass plate, without glue. In this case you need to make sure that the glass plate is completely free&nbsp;from dust and oil though, because plastic won&rsquo;t stick well to a greasy surface. There are however situations in which&nbsp;glue on the glass plate is desired. If you want to print a model that has a big footprint, or with very thin parts at the&nbsp;bottom it&rsquo;s advised to use glue to prevent it from getting loose.</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO USE?</strong><br />The glue stick that was delivered with your Ultimaker 2+ can be used for the glass plate. To use glue, simply put a thin,&nbsp;even layer on the glass plate. It is only necessary to apply glue to the print area.</p>
<p><img id="img1" src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2plus_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image016.png?raw=true" alt="" width="63" height="53" /></p>
<p>To better distribute the glue over the platform, you can use a damp cloth. This way a very thin layer of glue will<br />be left on the glass plate.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2plus_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image081.png?raw=true" alt="" width="612" height="407" /></p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h3>CHANGING NOZZLES</h3>
<p>A Nozzle Kit is supplied with the Ultimaker 2+. This kit contains three nozzle sizes (0.25 mm, 0.6 mm and 0.8 mm).&nbsp;The 0.4 mm nozzle is already installed on the Ultimaker 2+.</p>
<p>To replace the nozzle:</p>
<p><strong>REMOVING THE CURRENT NOZZLE</strong><br />1. Remove the filament from the Ultimaker 2+ (via the &ldquo;Material&rdquo; &gt; &ldquo;Change&rdquo; menu). See &ldquo;LOADING AND CHANGING&nbsp;FILAMENT&rdquo; on page 22.<br />2. Perform the Atomic Method before removing the currently installed nozzle. This minimizes the amount of leftover&nbsp;plastic that is locking down the nozzle and makes removal easier. It also cleans out that nozzle prior to storage,&nbsp;ensuring that no filament residue remains in the nozzle that may affect future prints. See &ldquo;ATOMIC METHOD&rdquo; on&nbsp;page 31.<br />3. Leave the temperature set to the last temperature that was used for pulling out the filament during the Atomic<br />Method. (e.g. 90 degrees Celcius for PLA).<br />4. Use the wrench to unscrew the nozzle from the heater block. To unscrew it, you have to turn it counter-clockwise.</p>
<p><strong>INSTALLING A NEW NOZZLE</strong><br />1. Select the desired nozzle and screw it manually into the heater block until hand-tight. Be careful, the heater block is&nbsp;still warm.<br />2. Use the wrench to tighten the nozzle completely. Turn it clockwise and don&rsquo;t use too much force (if you tighten it&nbsp;too much, it can break).&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2plus_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image083.jpg?raw=true" alt="" width="379" height="252" />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2+_user_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image084.jpg?raw=true" alt="" width="383" height="255" /></p>
<p><strong>SETTING UP IN CURA</strong><br />Before being able to print with the newly installed nozzle, the setting in Cura needs to be changed. Enter the size of&nbsp;your installed nozzle, in millimeter, in the &ldquo;Nozzle size&rdquo; field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5&nbsp;MAINTENANCE</h2>
<h3>In order to have a smoothly working Ultimaker 2+, it is important to maintain it&nbsp;correctly. This chapter describes the most important maintenance tips. Read them&nbsp;carefully in order to achieve the best results with your Ultimaker 2+.</h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>GLASS PLATE</h3>
<p><strong>CLEANING THE GLASS PLATE</strong><br />After a lot of printing, there might be too much excess glue stuck to the glass plate. This can cause an uneven print&nbsp;surface and it is therefore recommended to clean the glass plate once in a while. When doing this, always make sure&nbsp;that the Ultimaker 2+ is turned off and build plate has cooled down.</p>
<p>To clean the glass plate:</p>
<p>1. Move the build plate manually to the bottom of the Ultimaker 2+. This way possible damage on the print head or&nbsp;Z trapezoidal leadscrew is prevented.<br />2. Open up the build plate clamps at the front side.<br />3. Slide the glass plate to the front of the build plate until you can take it out of the Ultimaker 2+.<br />4. Remove any excess glue with some warm water and a cloth. If necessary, you can also use some soap to clean it.<br />5. Slide the glass plate onto the build plate until it snaps into place at the back of the build plate.<br />6. Close the build plate clamps at the front side by hand in order to secure it.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2plus_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image087.png?raw=true" alt="" width="387" height="257" />&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2+_user_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image088.png?raw=true" alt="" width="386" height="257" /></p>
<p><img id="img1" src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2plus_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image015.gif?raw=true" alt="" width="44" height="38" /></p>
<p>The glass plate is positioned on an electrical heating area, so make sure it is completely dry before placing it<br />back.</p>
<p><img id="img1" src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2plus_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image016.png?raw=true" alt="" width="55" height="46" /></p>
<p>To ensure a successful next print, we recommend to re-level the build plate after repositioning repositioned<br />the glass plate.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>THE FEEDER</h3>
<p>Using the feeder in the right way and keeping it clean is important for a good extrusion. These are tips to maintain the&nbsp;feeder.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FEEDER TENSION</strong><br />In order to guide the filament properly through the feeder into the bowden tube and print head, it is important that the&nbsp;tension on the feeder is set correctly. If the tension is too high, it means that the knurled wheel of the feeder will dig into&nbsp;the filament, through which it flattens or gets stuck. This is called grinding.</p>
<p>To prevent grinding of the filament, ensure that the white insert clip at the right side of the feeder is set in the middle.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2plus_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image090.png?raw=true" alt="" width="622" height="413" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>LUBRICATING THE AXES</h3>
<p>To maintain your Ultimaker 2+ correctly and keep it running smoothly, it is recommended to lubricate the axes<br />periodically.</p>
<p><strong>X AND Y AXES</strong><br />When you notice small ridges on the surfaces of your 3D printed objects or feel that the X and Y axes are dry, it is&nbsp;advised to put a single drop of sewing machine oil onto the X and Y axes. This will help your Ultimaker 2+ to run&nbsp;smoothly. Sewing machine oil is not included in the Ultimaker 2+ package, but we highly recommend using only this&nbsp;to lubricate the X and Y axes.</p>
<p><strong>Z TRAPEZOIDAL LEADSCREW</strong><br />Once every 6 months, the Z trapezoidal leadscrew has to be lubricated with Magnalube. This is the green grease that&nbsp;was delivered with your Ultimaker 2+. Spread 10 drops of grease over the entire threaded rod. With your next print, the&nbsp;Ultimaker 2+ will lubricate the axis by moving up and down.</p>
<p><img id="img1" src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2plus_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image015.gif?raw=true" alt="" width="44" height="38" /></p>
<p>Magnalube should be applied to the Z trapezoidal leadscrew only; do not put it on any of the other axes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2plus_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image092.png?raw=true" alt="" width="392" height="261" />&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2+_user_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image093.png?raw=true" alt="" width="397" height="264" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>ATOMIC METHOD</h3>
<p>After longer use of your Ultimaker 2+, you might notice that it cannot extrude enough plastic anymore. This so called&nbsp;under extrusion is usually shown by very thin or missing layers in a print. In most cases, it is caused by some dirt or&nbsp;carbonized material in the nozzle or another hot end part through which a (partial) blockage is created. When under&nbsp;extrusion appears, it is recommended to use the Atomic Method in order to clean the nozzle and other hot end parts.</p>
<p>Below, the steps of this method are described.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img id="img1" src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2plus_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image016.png?raw=true" alt="" width="63" height="53" /></p>
<p>It is also advised to use the Atomic Method when switching from a material that needs a higher printing<br />temperature to one that uses a lower printing temperature in order to make sure any residue from the<br />previous filament is removed.</p>
<p><strong>REMOVING THE FILAMENT</strong><br />1. Go to &ldquo;Material&rdquo; &gt; &ldquo;Change&rdquo; in order to remove the filament. Instead of inserting new material, select &ldquo;Cancel&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>REMOVING THE BOWDEN TUBE</strong><br />1. Remove the (blue or red) clamp clip.<br />2. Press down the tube coupling collet and pull the bowden tube out of the print head.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2plus_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image096.png?raw=true" alt="" width="362" height="240" />&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2+_user_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image097.png?raw=true" alt="" width="364" height="242" /></p>
<p><strong>HEATING UP AND PREPARING</strong><br />1. Go to &ldquo;Maintenance&rdquo; &gt; &ldquo;Advanced&rdquo; &gt; &ldquo;Heatup Nozzle&rdquo; and set the temperature to 260 degrees.<br />2. Cut off approximately 20 cm of filament with a straight cut and try to straighten the filament as much as possible.<br />3. When the temperature is reached, insert the straightened piece of filament manually all the way down to the nozzle.<br />4. Push it slightly until either the new filament comes out of the nozzle or until the filament cannot be pushed any&nbsp;further.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2plus_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image099.png?raw=true" alt="" width="361" height="241" />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2+_user_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image100.png?raw=true" alt="" width="371" height="246" /></p>
<p><strong>REMOVING THE NEW FILAMENT</strong><br />1. Lower the temperature to 90 degrees (for PLA) or 110 degrees (for ABS).<br />2. Pull the filament out with a quick, firm pull, once the temperature has been reached.<br />3. Check the color and shape of the tip of the filament; the goal is to have a clean, cone-shaped tip.<br />4. Repeat &ldquo;heating up and preparing&rdquo; and &ldquo;removing the new filament&rdquo; until the filament comes out without any<br />residue and has a cone-shaped tip.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2plus_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image102.png?raw=true" alt="" width="385" height="256" />&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/uui/blob/master/help/oer/ultimaker_2+_user_manual/ultimaker_2+_user_manual_images/image103.png?raw=true" alt="" width="394" height="261" /></p>
<p><strong>RE-ASSEMBLING</strong><br />1. Insert the bowden tube through the tube coupling collet all the way down into the TFM coupler.<br />2. Place the clamp clip around the tube coupling collet so that it secures the bowden tube.</p>

<h2>6 HELP &amp; SUPPORT</h2>
<h3>There are a few printer specific issues that could occur while using your Ultimaker&nbsp;2+. If you run into one of these issues, you can troubleshoot the issue yourself with&nbsp;help of the information on the next pages.</h3>
<h3>Of course, we also have local support teams in case you need personal support.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>TROUBLESHOOTING</h3>
<p>This chapter describes the most common issues and how to fix them. The next page gives an overview of possible error&nbsp;messages on the Ultimaker 2+. For more instructions, visit our website: <a href="http://www.ultimaker.com/support">www.ultimaker.com/support</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>EXTRUSION PROBLEMS</strong><br />Extrusion problems can have several reasons. The nozzle could be blocked, so no material can come out. It could also&nbsp;mean that the Ultimaker 2+ does not extrude enough plastic, leading to very thin or missing layers in a print. This is&nbsp;called &ldquo;under extrusion&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In most cases, extrusion problems are caused by some dirt or carbonized material in the nozzle (or another hot end&nbsp;part) through which a (partial) blockage is created. In order to solve this you can:</p>
<p><br />&bull; Check if the filament has not grinded in the feeder. If it did, remove it from the machine first.<br />&bull; Ensure that the white insert clip to set the tension on the feeder is in the middle.<br />&bull; Try manually to extrude some material by using the &lsquo;Move material&rsquo; option in the Advanced menu. You can put<br />some extra force on it by manually pushing the material at the feeder while doing this.<br />&bull; Use the Atomic Method to remove any dirt or carbonized material from the hot end.</p>
<p>After having used the Ultimaker 2+ for a longer time, it could also mean that the TFM coupler has deformed, causing&nbsp;friction to the filament. This consumable item has the tendency to wear over time due to the heat and pressure from&nbsp;the hot end. If none of the above described options works, it is advised to take a closer look at the TFM coupler.</p>
<p>A deformed TFM coupler can be recognized by a (small) brim on the inside at the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>CANNOT CONNECT TO CURA</strong><br />If Cura does not recognize your Ultimaker 2+ when you want to upload firmware, there is a problem with the connection&nbsp;due to software or hardware failure. In order to solve this you can:</p>
<p><br />&bull; Make sure everything is connected properly (power supply and USB cable) and that the Ultimaker 2+ is turned on&nbsp;when uploading firmware. You can also try another USB cable.<br />&bull; Check if the latest version of Cura is installed on your computer.<br />&bull; Try connecting to a different computer, preferably with a different operating system.</p>
<p><strong>PRINT NOT STICKING TO BUILD PLATE</strong><br />When prints do not stick to the build plate, a few things could be wrong. It could either mean that the first layer does&nbsp;not stick well enough or that the prints gets loose due to &ldquo;warping&rdquo; of the plastic. Warping basically happens because&nbsp;of the properties of the plastic. Plastics have the tendency to shrink when cooling down fast (some plastics more than&nbsp;others), which could eventually lead to your print curling up (at the corners). You will especially notice this behavior&nbsp;when printing ABS, which has a relatively big shrinkage.</p>
<p><br />In order to decrease the amount of warping and have a good first layer you can:</p>
<p><br />&bull; Check if the heated bed is set to the correct temperature (60 &deg;C for PLA and 90 &deg;C for ABS).<br />&bull; Make sure that the build plate is properly leveled.<br />&bull; Clean the glass plate completely.<br />&bull; Apply a thin layer of glue to the glass plate.<br />&bull; Use the &ldquo;Brim&rdquo; feature in Cura to prevent warping. &ldquo;Brim&rdquo; will place a single layer thick flat area around your object,&nbsp;thus creating a bigger adhesion surface.</p>
