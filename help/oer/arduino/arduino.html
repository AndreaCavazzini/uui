Arduino Board


A simple computer in the format of microcontroller development board.
You can program, monitor and communicate with Arduino boards, building circuits for interactions between components. They have digital and analogue pins that allow users to control actuators. Input components can be everything, from simple digital buttons to variable resistors and sensors. The Arduino board provides you ways to turn your projects into standalone, portable digital artefacts suitable for a wide variety of scenarios.
