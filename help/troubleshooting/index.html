<h2>This is an early draft of a trouble shooting guide</h2>
<h3>Trouble shooting advice</h3>
<p>
The eCraft2Larn Unified User Interface (the UUI) works best in Chrome.
If you encounter problems with other browsers please report it and switch to Chrome (or Chromium on Raspberry Pis).
</p>
<p>
If you are reading this on a Raspberry Pi that was configured by eCraft2Larn project members
then report any problems to them since all the following should have been done.
Click on one of the following links if you are having problems with:

<h4 id="snap4arduino">Snap4Ardunio trouble shooting</h4>
<p>
If you get a security warning about not trusting the certificate for snap4arduino.rocks, then you should be able
to click on Advanced Settings and click to visit the site anyway.
You should only need to do this once since the browser should remember it.
The Snap4Ardunio team is aware of the problem and is fixing it.
</p>
<p>
If Snap4Ardunio launches but cannot connect to the Arduino,
then first ensure that <a href="http://snap4arduino.rocks/#plugin">the Snap4Ardunio browser extension is installed</a>.
If the extension is installed and Snap4Ardunio still cannot connect to the Arduino on a USB port then sometimes
disconnecting and then reconnecting the USB cable resets the connection.
Remember it is always a good idea when finished running Snap4Ardunio to disconnect from the Arduino.

<h4 id="tinkercad-cura-on-raspberry-pi">Tinkercad and Cura trouble shooting</h4>
<p>
The only known problems with Tinkercad and Cura are that they are not usuable on Raspberry Pis.
Tinkercad can be too slow to be useful or it may show a black rectangle in the construction area.
Cura can't be run on the Raspberry Pi.
If your environment has been configured with servers running these programs on VNC then launch the VNC program.
Otherwise run them on a PC or Mac.
</p>
<h4 id="tinkercad-registration">Tinkercad requires a user register</h4>
<p>
If one registers and logs into Tinkercad then the UUI can be used to launch it for 3D modelling or for circuit design.
<b>We strongly recommend that users log into Tinkercad before launching it from the UUI.<b>
The browser can remember the login so the same user on the same computer need only do this once.
