<h2>This is an early draft of a trouble shooting guide</h2>
<h3>Trouble shooting advice</h3>
<p>
The eCraft2Larn Unified User Interface (the UUI) works best in Chrome.
If you encounter problems with other browsers please report it and switch to Chrome (or Chromium on Raspberry Pis).
</p>
<p>
If you are reading this on a Raspberry Pi that was configured by eCraft2Larn project members
then report any problems to them since all the following should have been done.
Click on one of the following links if you are having problems with:
<ul>
<li><a href="#snap4arduino">Snap4Ardunio</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ecraft2learn.github.io/ai/AI-Teacher-Guide/troubleshooting.html">AI Snap! Programming blocks</a></li>
<li>More to come</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you get a security warning about not trusting the certificate for snap4arduino.rocks, then you should be able
to click on Advanced Settings and click to visit the site anyway.
You should only need to do this once since the browser should remember it.
The Snap4Ardunio team is aware of the problem and is fixing it.
</p>
<p>
If Snap4Ardunio launches but cannot connect to the Arduino,
then first ensure that <a href="http://snap4arduino.rocks/#plugin">the Snap4Ardunio browser extension is installed</a>.
If the extension is installed and Snap4Ardunio still cannot connect to the Arduino on a USB port then sometimes
disconnecting and then reconnecting the USB cable resets the connection.
Remember it is always a good idea when finished running Snap4Ardunio to disconnect from the Arduino.
